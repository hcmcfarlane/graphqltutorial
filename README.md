# GraphQL tutorial

<p>A very quick first look at GraphQL. I followed the tutorial at
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/graphql-for-front-end-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freeCodeCamp</a>. Using this tutorial I learned:</p>

-   GraphQL is a query language and runtime
-   GraphQL helps solve problems of under- and over-fetching
-   Using ApolloClient to set up a client
-   Wrapping your root render in ApolloProvider to pass the client as context to your whole app
-   Setting up a query to give back the data structure you want
-   Adding variables to a query
